\section{ENVIRONMENT AND REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS}
\subsection{Purpose of Document}
The purpose of this document is to provide detailed requirements and design specifications as well as to describe the implementation process and result for the CMSC424 Database Design Project \textbf{History of Presidential Elections}. The document contains a description of limitations and assumptions about this model, a description of how to extract, transform and load data and how to build a web server. A top-level flow diagram is included in this document to show the logical flow of this project. Besides that, there are document forms as well as task forms to describe different tasks at each stage. For conceptual modeling, there is an ER model graphic schema and some functional dependencies derived. For logical modeling, there is a logical schema of the relational model. The document also has a list of design specification of each tasks, a user manual about each query that this project implements and some additional information.

\subsection{Purpose of Project}
The main goal of this project is to populate a relational database, called the Presidential Elections Database (PED), with data readily available on the Web. In this project, at ETL part, we need transform web HTML and XML data into a relational database that supports SQL querying and processing, format the data and integrate the data into a single relational database. Then we need to create a web-interface for users to interact and query the database. At last, a detailed report to describe tha analysis, design and implementation process will be produced.

\subsection{Scope}
The scope of this project involves multiple tasks. The first task is to research and collect reliable data source related to the history of the president elections in United States(1789 to 2016).
